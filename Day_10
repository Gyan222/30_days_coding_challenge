Given n non-negative integers a1,a2, a3...an.   where each represents a point at coordinate ‘ n ‘ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i,ai) and (i,0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

def maxArea(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
          
            # Calculating the max area
            area = max(area, min(arr[j], arr[i]) * (j - i))
    return area

a = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]
print(maxArea(a))
