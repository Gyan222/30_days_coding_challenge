Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell



Solutions:   


# Python Program to solve stock buy and sell by  
# exploring all possible pairs

def max_profit(prices):
    n = len(prices)
    res = 0

    # Explore all possible ways to buy and sell stock
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            res = max(res, prices[j] - prices[i])
    
    return res

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prices = [7, 10, 1, 3, 6, 9, 2]
    print(max_profit(prices))
