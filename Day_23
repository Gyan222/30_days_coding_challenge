Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower.

solution:

def minimizeHeightDifference(arr, n, k):
    n=len(arr)
    arr.sort()
    initial_diff = arr[-1] - arr[0]
    min_diff = initial_diff
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        tallest = max(arr[i] + k, arr[-1] - k)
        shortest = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i + 1] - k)
        if shortest >= 0:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, tallest - shortest)
    
    return min_diff
